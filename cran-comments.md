* This is a new release.

## Resubmission
This is a re-submission. In this version the following actions were taken:

1. Citations not needed in description, instead they were used as examples to test some functions but are not meant to be included in the description. Chose to remove the citations as they're not needed in the package. 

2. Fixed missing Rd-tags in extract and extract2

3. Removed `dontrun()` and added `donttest()` where appropriate to avoid loading data from external files.
