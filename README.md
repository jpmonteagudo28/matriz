The goal of `matriz` is to help you easily generate and manage
structured literature review matrices in R. The package aims to
streamline your research synthesis, track key study details, and
organize citations efficiently.

## Installation

You can install the development version of matriz like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jpmonteagudo28/matriz)
```

or you can download it from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("matriz")
```

## Intro

This document walks through the main steps of using `matriz`, from
setting up your matrix to searching and refining it.

#### Importing Literature Matrices

The first step is to bring your literature data into R. If you have an
existing matrix in CSV or another format, use the `import_matrix()`
function. Otherwise, create an empty matrix using `init_matrix()`:

``` r
library(matriz)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'matriz'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     truncate

lit_matrix <- init_matrix()

# Get matriz structure to guide in creating records
matriz_names()
#>                        class
#> year                 numeric
#> citation           character
#> keywords           character
#> profession         character
#> electronic           logical
#> purpose            character
#> study_design       character
#> outcome_var        character
#> predictor_var      character
#> sample               numeric
#> dropout_rate         numeric
#> setting            character
#> inclusion_criteria character
#> ethnicity          character
#> age                  numeric
#> sex                   factor
#> income                factor
#> education          character
#> measures           character
#> analysis           character
#> results            character
#> limitations        character
#> implications       character
#> ethical_concerns   character
#> biases             character
#> notes              character

# Start filling out individual record with article info
article <- data.frame(year = 2025,
                citation = " ",
                keywords = " ",
                profession = "underwater basket weaver",
                electronic = "YES",
                purpose = "To investigate the depth of the oceans and retireve weaving materials",
                study_design = "ethnography", 
                outcome_var = "perceived attitudes towards basket weaving",
                predictor_var = NA, 
                sample = "a small school of clown fish", 
                setting = "Italy",
                drop_rate = 0.13, 
                inclusion_criteria = "clow fish in Adriatic Sea", 
                ehtnicity = "oceanic", 
                age = "0 - 1 year",
                sex = "both",
                income = " ",
                education = "none",
                measures = "perceived attitudes",
                analysis = "qualitative", 
                results = "no significant differences",
                limitations = "small sample size", 
                implications = "clow fish don't like humans taking their homes for their own basket weaving endeavors",
                ethical_concerns = "no informed consent given to school of clown fish",
                biases = "clownfish always try to be funny. Lack of seriounness",
                notes = "more research needed")


# Process and add the citation to the current record
bibtex <- system.file("examples","example.bib",package = "matriz")

cited_article <- process_citation(article,bibtex)


# Add the record to the literature matrix
lit_matrix <- add_record(lit_matrix, cited_article, .before = 1)

# Update record if mistake was made
lit_matrix <- update_record(lit_matrix, notes, where = year == 2025, set_to = "actually, the clow fish don't want us to come back.")
```

#### Merging Matrices

If you have multiple literature matrices and need to combine them, use
`merge_matrix()`. This function ensures that duplicate columns are
removed before merging.

> **Note**: If your article summaries are lists and their element
> classes differ from those in the init_matrix data frame, using
> add_batch_record() may coerce all elements to lists instead of
> preserving their original classes.

``` r
# Merge two literature matrices by a common column (e.g., "study_id")
additional_matrix <- lit_matrix
combined_matrix <- merge_matrix(lit_matrix, additional_matrix, by = "year", all = TRUE)
#> Removing duplicate columns...

# if you rather bind the two matrices together by rows, use 'add_batch_record()'
lit_matrix <- add_batch_record(lit_matrix, additional_matrix)
```

#### Searching for Records

Once your matrix is set up, you might need to search for specific
studies based on keywords, author names, or topics. Use
`search_record()` to filter the matrix for relevant entries.

#### Exporting the Final Matrix

Once youâ€™ve refined and categorized your literature review, you can
export the matrix for further use in Excel or other tools using
`export_matrix()`.

This structured workflow should make managing literature reviews more
efficient and streamlined.
