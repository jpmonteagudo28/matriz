The goal of `matriz` is to help you easily generate and manage structured literature review matrices in R. The package aims to streamline your research synthesis, track key study details, and organize citations efficiently.

## Installation

You can install the development version of matriz like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jpmonteagudo28/matriz)
```

or you can download it from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("matriz")
```

## Intro 

This document walks through the main steps of using `matriz`, from setting up your matrix to searching and refining it.


####  Importing Literature Matrices

The first step is to bring your literature data into R. If you have an existing matrix in CSV or another format, use the `import_matrix()` function. Otherwise, create an empty matrix using `init_matrix()`:

```{r example}
library(matriz)

lit_matrix <- init_matrix()

#Print empty matrix
str(lit_matrix)

# Start filling out individual record with article info
article <- data.frame(year = 2025,
                citation = " ",
                keywords = " ",
                profession = "underwater basket weaver",
                electronic = "YES",
                purpose = "To investigate the depth of the oceans and retireve weaving materials",
                study_design = "ethnography", 
                outcome_var = "perceived attitudes towards basket weaving",
                predictor_var = NA, 
                sample = "a small school of clown fish", 
                setting = "Italy",
                drop_rate = 0.13, 
                inclusion_criteria = "clow fish in Adriatic Sea", 
                ehtnicity = "oceanic", 
                age = "0 - 1 year",
                sex = "both",
                income = " ",
                education = "none",
                measures = "perceived attitudes",
                analysis = "qualitative", 
                results = "no significant differences",
                limitations = "small sample size", 
                implications = "clow fish don't like humans taking their homes for their own basket weaving endeavors",
                ethical_concerns = "no informed consent given to school of clown fish",
                biases = "clownfish always try to be funny. Lack of seriounness",
                notes = "more research needed")


# Process and add the citation to the current record
bibtex <- system.file("examples","example.bib",package = "matriz")

cited_article <- process_citation(article,bibtex)


# Add the record to the literature matrix
lit_matrix <- add_record(lit_matrix, cited_article, .before = 1)

# Update record if mistake was made
lit_matrix <- update_record(lit_matrix, notes, where = year == 2025, set_to = "actually, the clow fish don't want us to come back.")


```


#### Merging Matrices  

If you have multiple literature matrices and need to combine them, use `merge_matrix()`. This function ensures that duplicate columns are removed before merging.

>**Note**: If your article summaries are lists and their element classes differ from those in the init_matrix data frame, using add_batch_record() may coerce all elements to lists instead of preserving their original classes.

```{r merging}
# Merge two literature matrices by a common column (e.g., "study_id")
additional_matrix <- lit_matrix
combined_matrix <- merge_matrix(lit_matrix, additional_matrix, by = "year", all = TRUE)

# if you rather bind the two matrices together by rows, use 'add_batch_record()'
lit_matrix <- add_batch_record(lit_matrix, additional_matrix)

```


#### Searching for Records  

Once your matrix is set up, you might need to search for specific studies based on keywords, author names, or topics. Use `search_record()` to filter the matrix for relevant entries.


#### Exporting the Final Matrix

Once youâ€™ve refined and categorized your literature review, you can export the matrix for further use in Excel or other tools using `export_matrix()`.

This structured workflow should make managing literature reviews more efficient and streamlined.
