  abstract={This ethnographic study investigates the complex relationship between underwater basket weavers and local clownfish populations in the Adriatic Sea. Through qualitative analysis of clownfish behavioral patterns, the research reveals significant tensions between traditional craft practices and marine habitat preservation. The study highlights the absence of proper consent protocols in marine craft research and emphasizes the need for more sustainable approaches to underwater resource gathering. Notable limitations include small sample size and the inherent challenges in interpreting clownfish behavior, with observed bias in data collection due to the species' playful nature.},
